LRC File Format
LRC is a lyrics file format with time tags to synchronize the lyrics with the audio file (MP3 file for example).
LRC files are basically text files, so you can read them with any text editor.

The main issue of the basic LRC file is that the syncs are done line by line and not syllable by syllable.
Hopefully, an recent extension to this format allows to specify a time tag for each word.

The LRC files start with some information tags, the two most important are artist and title:
[ar:Artist name here]
[ti:Title of the song]

Then comes the lyrics, with the synchronization tags:
[mm:ss.xx]word 1<mm:ss.xx> word 2 <mm:ss.xx> ...
To make it easier, let's show an example:
[00:43.75]Let <00:43.96>it <00:44.16>be

The purpose of this website is to provide only enhanced LRC files for all the karaoke enthusiasts!
And if you create some enhanced LRC files, why not submitting them for the other users?
