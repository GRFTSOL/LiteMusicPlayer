# Introduction

The current music players have more and more features, are getting larger, slower, and less user-friendly. This is a project I created just for my own enjoyment, with limited time investment, so I can only work on it occasionally.

# Features

* Supports music library and search
* Displays lyrics
* Skin switching and customizable skins
* Music library management is done through a browser management approach, facilitating feature expansion and development (not completed)
* Cross-platform: Windows, Mac OS

# Development

## Development Environment

* C++, VSCode
* Windows: VisualStudio Communication 2022
* Mac: XCode
* CMake
* Node.js 18 (Vue + Quasar)
* Python 3: Required for compilation
